Rotten Fruits and Vegetables Detector : 
A deep learning-based application designed to detect rotten fruits and vegetables using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). This project aims to assist in maintaining food quality and safety by accurately identifying spoiled produce from images.

Features:
High Accuracy: Utilizes a robust CNN architecture to achieve high accuracy in detecting rotten produce(90%).
Image Preprocessing: Includes image augmentation techniques to improve model generalization.
Real-time Detection: Capable of real-time detection and classification of fruits and vegetables.
User-friendly Interface: Simple and intuitive interface for easy usage.

Model Architecture:
Convolutional Layers: Extract features from input images.
Pooling Layers: Reduce dimensionality while retaining essential features.
Fully Connected Layers: Learn complex patterns and make final predictions.
Dropout Layers: Prevent overfitting during training.
Future Plans
Dataset Expansion: Incorporate more types of fruits and vegetables.
Transfer Learning: Utilize pre-trained models to enhance performance.
Mobile Integration: Develop a mobile application for on-the-go detection.
Continuous Updates: Periodic retraining with new data for sustained accuracy.
